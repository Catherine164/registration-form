# registration-form
Step : Hosting the Application
To host the application on a cloud platform, you can use platforms like Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel. However, because PHP is involved in this application, you may need to use a platform that supports PHP backend.

Hereâ€™s a simple way to host using Heroku:

Install Heroku CLI (if you haven't already) from Heroku's website.
Create a Procfile in the root of your project folder with the following content: web:   php -S 0.0.0.0:$PORT

Initialize a git repository in your project folder:
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"

Login to Heroku via the terminal:   heroku login

Create a new Heroku application:  heroku create

Deploy your application: git push heroku master

After deployment, you will receive a URL where your web application is hosted.
Step: Test the Application
Visit the URL provided by Heroku to see your online registration form. When users submit the form, it should display the entered information in a formatted style.

Optional Enhancements
Add client-side form validation using JavaScript before submission.
Add database integration (e.g., MySQL) to store the submitted form data.
Add more fields to the form (like date of birth, gender, etc.) for additional functionality.
